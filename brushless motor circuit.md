# circuit-to-controlling-brushless-motor-with-arduino-uno

To control brushless motor we need a circuit to contorl its 3 phase wires while we get a sequence between them to start movement.we called this circuit electronic speed controller(ESC).

ESC has 3 output wires for motor and 3 input . 2 of input wires are used for supply power for motor and 1 for pwm signal from arduino . signal input wire has 3 branch one for + other for - and one for pwm (+ wire not nesscary to connect it ).
